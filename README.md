# libLX

--- 

LibLX is a free, open-source programming XML parsing library derived from [LibSBML](http://sbml.org/Software/libSBML). It provides a common interface to underlying XML libraries, currently libXML, Xerces and Expat. This allows developers to read, write, manipulate, and validate XML files in their software systems, regardless of what XML libraries are available. It is written in C++ and will provide language bindings for other programming languages.

**LibLX authors and contributors_**

LibLX is derived from the XML portion of LibSBML. LibSBML's main authors are [Sarah M. Keating](https://github.com/skeating), [Frank T. Bergmann](https://www.cos.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php/f.bergmann/?l=_e), [Lucian P. Smith](https://github.com/luciansmith), [Brett G.
